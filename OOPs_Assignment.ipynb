        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data (attributes) and functions (methods). It allows you to model real-world entities and relationships in your code, making it more modular, reusable, and organized.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior (via attributes and methods) that its instances (objects) will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - An object in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in Python is an instance of a class. It’s a concrete entity based on the class blueprint and holds data (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Encapsulation is about bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit — the class — and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.Abstraction is about hiding unnecessary details from the user and only showing the essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Dunder methods in Python (also known as magic methods or special methods) are methods that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names — hence the name \"dunder\" (short for \"double underscore\").\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Inheritance is an OOP concept where one class (called a child or subclass) inherits the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) of another class (called a parent or superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Polymorphism means \"many forms\". In OOP, it refers to the ability of different classes to respond to the same method name in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components.In short: It’s about protecting your data and exposing only what’s necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created from a class. Its main job is to initialize the object's attributes (i.e., set up its initial state).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A class method is a method that is bound to the class rather than the instance of the class. This means that it can be called on the class itself, and it takes a reference to the class (cls) as its first argument instead of a reference to the instance (self).A static method is a method that doesn't take a reference to the instance (self) or the class (cls). It behaves like a regular function, but it's defined inside a class. Static methods don’t modify the state of the object or the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - In Python, method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but with different arguments (either a different number of parameters or different types). However, unlike some other languages (like Java or C++), Python does not support traditional method overloading directly. This is because Python is a dynamically-typed language and does not allow multiple methods with the same name to be defined in the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Method Overriding is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept where a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The child class method with the same name and signature replaces or overrides the method in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The @property decorator in Python is used to define getter methods in a class. It allows you to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute, providing encapsulation and controlled access to an instance's attributes. This is particularly useful when you want to manage the internal state of an object but prefer to interact with it using simple attribute access instead of method calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Polymorphism is one of the key pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it is incredibly important because it allows for greater flexibility, extensibility, and reusability of code. In Python+ (with OOP), polymorphism enables us to design systems where different objects can respond to the same method call in different ways, making our programs more adaptable and scalable.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  What is an abstract class in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It is meant to be inherited by other classes that provide implementations for the abstract methods defined in the abstract class. Abstract classes are used to define common methods that subclasses must implement while providing default behavior for others.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What are the advantages of OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a widely used programming paradigm that organizes code into objects and classes. This approach offers several advantages that make it highly suitable for managing complex systems, promoting maintainability, and improving code reusability and readability. Such as Modularity, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - A class variable is a variable that is shared across all instances of a class. It is associated with the class itself, rather than any particular instance. All instances of the class share the same value for a class variable. If the class variable is modified, the change is reflected in all instances that access it.An instance variable is a variable that is specific to a particular instance of the class. Each object created from the class will have its own copy of the instance variable. These variables are usually initialized in the __init__ method and are prefixed with self, making them unique to the instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from multiple classes, which can help in creating more flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The __str__ method is meant to return a human-readable string representation of an object. It's used when you call print() or str() on an object. The goal of __str__ is to provide a clean, user-friendly, and informative string representation of the object. The __repr__ method is intended to return a developer-friendly string representation of the object. Its primary purpose is to provide an unambiguous, detailed representation that can help developers understand the object’s state. If possible, the string returned by __repr__ should ideally allow for the recreation of the object (i.e., it should look like valid Python code that could recreate the object when passed to eval()).\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "      - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class in the context of inheritance. It is typically used in method overriding (when a child class redefines a method from a parent class) to call the parent class's method from within the child class. This allows the child class to extend or modify the behavior of the inherited method, while still being able to invoke the original method from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed, i.e., when it is no longer referenced or when it is being garbage collected. This method allows you to define any cleanup or resource-releasing behavior that should occur before an object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - A @staticmethod is a method that belongs to the class but does not have access to the class or the instance. It behaves like a regular function but resides within the class's namespace.Static methods are generally used for utility functions that are logically related to the class but don't need to access or modify the class or instance attributes.A @classmethod is a method that belongs to the class and takes the class itself as its first argument (usually named cls). This allows the method to access or modify class-level attributes and methods.Class methods are commonly used for factory methods, class-level data manipulation, or when you want the method to operate on the class itself rather than an instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Polymorphism in Python is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It works especially well in the context of inheritance, where a child class can provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class. This enables the same method name to behave differently depending on the object calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Method chaining in Python refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object, one after another, in a single line of code. It is typically used to improve readability and conciseness when multiple operations need to be performed on the same object.Method chaining is possible because each method in the chain must return the object itself (or some other object) so that the next method can be called on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The __call__ method in Python is a special or \"dunder\" (double underscore) method that allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. This method enables an object to behave like a function, meaning you can invoke the object with parentheses and arguments, just like you would call a regular function."
